    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Using some fresh and some canned ingredients, this chili is a snap to throw together and will keep you craving it for days.
         Chunky zucchini, fresh green onion, sour cream, and - what the heck - shredded Cheddar cheese, are sure to make this your
        favorite chili recipe. If you like beans in your chili, garbanzos right out of the can are great in this.</p>

        <li>Pour in beef broth, and simmer to reduce liquid slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>While chili is still cooking, heat one tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. </li>
        <li>In the same skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat.
             Add the zucchini, and cook stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Ladle chili into serving bowls. Top with sour cream, green onion, and cheddar cheese, and serve.</li>
