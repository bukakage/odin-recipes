    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Using some fresh and some canned ingredients, this chili is a snap to throw together and will keep you craving it for days.
         Chunky zucchini, fresh green onion, sour cream, and - what the heck - shredded Cheddar cheese, are sure to make this your
        favorite chili recipe. If you like beans in your chili, garbanzos right out of the can are great in this.</p>
